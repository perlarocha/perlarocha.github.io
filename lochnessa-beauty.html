          </strong></p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            I began by identifying the client's overall needs. Currently, she only gains new clients through Instagram or by referrals, but is constantly being asked for prices and availability even when those are mentioned in her Instagram bio and on several posts. 
          </p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            I conducted interviews among some of her current clients as well as a few others that fit the demographic. I asked them what information is the most important when needing to make an appointment. One of the main recurring answers was a need for appointment scheduling.

            </h3>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            According to several sources, building a professional website is key to brand yourself as a true business. They identify 4 common target pages for the website including an attractive home page, online booking services, a portfolio of works, and pages dedicated to services offered. 
          </p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            A makeup artist website must appeal to first-time and returning users, the main audience consisting of women between 18 and 35 years of age. With users of this age group, creating both a mobile and desktop site would be beneficial for increasing new visitors and maintaing client retention.
