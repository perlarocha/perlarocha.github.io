          <p class="project-info-detail"><strong>
            Titanfall 2 is the sequel to the science-fiction first-person shooter Titanfall developed by Respawn Entertainment. It features single player campaign and multiplayer modes. 
          </strong></p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
              With several positive reviews above 89%, it seems to be an all near-perfect game. However, even with such stellar ratings, no game can escape complaints. What Titanfall succeeds in with story and overall gameplay, it lacks in UI.

            I began by identifying points I noticed hindered my own experience while playing the game. I reached out to my friend group and found others who had noticed some design flaws while they also played. I interviewed them and wrote down their responses then watched them interact with the gameplay, recording any instances where they verbally or physically displayed frustration.

            </p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            The UI of most futuristic first person shooters follow a semi-Meta type UI. In other words, the elements that make up the important information for the player are displayed on the screen in a way that fits in with the overall style and narrative of the game. In Titanfall 2, these elements are displayed on the HUD (Heads Up Display) and fit the aesthetic, especially when piloting a Titan. However, one of the main problems isn't with the layout itself, but more so the overload of information that occurs when in multiplayer matches. This can also be seen in several other multiplayer first person shooters such as Call of Duty and Battlefield.
          </p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            Displayed on the HUD are the player stats, team information, spatial information, the minimap, game mode name/score/timer, and the reward system which out of all the elements seems to be the most redundant and bothersome. When playing an intense match, being able to see the full extent of the screen is crucial, so bombarding the screen with reward badges, banners, kill streaks just add to the chaos. I believe these elements can either be done without or can be added with audio or smaller, less frequent visual cues, still adding positive feedback.
          </p>

          <p class="project-info-detail">
            While looking up details about the game itself, I came across several reviews and reddit threads that actually pointed out very similar frustrations to those I heard in the interviews. Of them, the most commonly disscussed issue was the overload of information that occurs right in the middle of action-packed moments in multiplayer matches. Using this information I was able to focus on the main elements that needed change.

            At the beginning of my design process I sketched out the intended positions of elements on the screens. I wanted to maintain the same feel to Titanfall that has already been established, just changing a few elements to improve the user experience.

              <li class="details"> This helped me to visualize the important details that needed to be displayed on each screen.

            Once I started arranging the assets on AdobeXD, I noticed some other areas that could be further improved. Per user's request, I added the match best feature with an added toggle function to swith between match totals/individual stats and the match bests.

            Keeping in mind the styles of other fps games, I opted for a background that included map images with a dark overlay in lieu of the colored background. I also used more color as a highlight for selections.
